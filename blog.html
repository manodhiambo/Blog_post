<h1>HOW WE DESIGNED AND LAUNCHED A HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT APP</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<img src="first.jpeg" alt="A landing page image">
<P>This past month, We released a project that we have been working on for a while that brought together a major idea, the next step into this developing world of technology, a digital, file manager which allows input, storage,retrieval and manipulation of data: A hospital management system. Our collaboration has been authorized by Holberton School of technology. Both the team members: Felix Abongo, Nandweza Allan and I(Kevin Odhiambo) being students, did a research on what is lucking in our community and came up with the idea of the project, solely to solve the analog method of data storage in most of our local hospitals.

The project is an officially approved Hospital Management System, which was made via a combination of our design, Kevin Odhiambo being set for the front-end, Felix Abongo being in charge of the back-end and Nandweza Allan ensured that both ends meet, API. </p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Each and everyone of us had different ideas before we settled for this one final project that has led to a change in our hospital sectors. What we knew for sure was that each and everyone of us had a specific  specialisatin point and this what made us to merge as a team to come up with this final project. When we finally setlled for the project, we were sure that the requirements for it's completion we well advanced into our knowledge. We then divided what was needed for the project with what each and everyone of us could do best and hence the role division. I would also like to stress that the roles taken by each member is well deepened into them. When given any task partaining such, would do extra-work, more than satisfaction. My team when given a chance does everything beyond the expectations.At Holbrton, we have learn grit,doing hard thing and making our hands dirty to provide the solution to what is lacking in our community. We also understands that the only way to solve a problem is to get involved, being the actor and being the first one to initiate the move. Don't expect anyone to come solve your problems when they have theirs too... These are some of the tips that ensures that we depends on no one but ourselves.</p>
<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
<p>This is what we have done so far as a team to ensure that our project result is ready for consummers. The images shows the layout of the basics of the project.This app accepts input of data, which get stored in the database SQLAlchemy, python, MySQL, and ORM..The use of REST API ensured access and use of the input data. For exaple in a section where the patient want to book for the treatment, they will be ask to input: their names, contact and email address. Once done, the "Book Now" button would send the data to the database, to be accesed by the department in charge, who would respond to the the client vie an email or a phone call. The merit of this flow of information is that such records are kept for future references, just in case the doctor in charge never took a proper action for the respose on client request, the organisation can take an action against such. Such data are very safe, even with a viral attack on the system, data loss will be minimal as compared to paper work.To esure that our app looks attractive and functional, we used HTML and CSS.. to merge the fully functional app,REST API was used.

<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
<p>While implementing the Hospital Management System in the healthcare industry,some few technical challenges that failed include; Networks and computer having different maintenance problems, lack of no standards for data entry and data retrieval, difficulty in training users technically to use HMS </p>
<h3>Way Forward</h3>
<p>Throughout this project, technically I have come to realise that most of our local hospitals have a poor network problem, most of the users also lack the kwnoledge to implement the app.
Due to this , I have come to realise that some of these technologies, however good they might be,can prove useless to the groups who have no proper technical training. In future, I would recommend a mass training on the the applicatin of any consumable before launching one.
As an engineer, it is sometimes important to know your targrtted group, the problem that your your work is meant to solve and how easily your product would implemented by the users.
This project acted as a pathway to show me the depth of what I can do,it acted as an encouraging factor to this my engineering career. Before it, I was not sure of what i could do, and what I could not. After it, I understood my strenths and weakness.
Actually I was used to emacs editor, but I came to realised that Vim is also one of the best. you can try it out too </p>
<h3>conclussion</h3>
<p>I am a passionate engineer who can do anything to ensure that the solution is available to the problem. Always ready to learn and very  adptive in new environment. The links below will take you to your desired destinations:
